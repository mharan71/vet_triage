# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Problem Statement

A common issue I have observed while working in the emergency veterinary industry is
the lack of specific software which provides a useful and user-friendly interface for incoming
patients (primarily, I have observed the use of a Google Document for this). In my opinion, this
is an insufficient method for handling cases considering the time sensitivity and critical nature
associated with patients that have major injuries.

# Key Benefits

The use of a specifically engineered application would help to better manage time
sensitive cases, prevent user error, and add a level of security otherwise unavailable in the
previously mentioned methods for triaging patients (Google Documents). An application that
better implements these features has the potential to help save the lives of patients.

# Proposed Solution

This project aims to develop a web application that functions to organize and prioritize incoming
patients in emergency and urgent care veterinary hospitals. Furthermore, this application will
ensure proper and efficient patient intake by creating a user-friendly interface, streamlining the
intake process for staff members. It will utilize a backend to handle the processing of data and
real-time updates, and a database for secure data management. 

# Target Audience

The target audience would be large and small scale emergency and urgent care veterinary hospitals.
